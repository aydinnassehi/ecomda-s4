    "This session will introduce key Python tools for data analysis and visualisation, focusing on fundamental concepts to support your learning in the unit. You will explore NumPy for handling numerical data, learn how to create basic plots, work with Pandas to manipulate datasets, and move on to advanced plotting techniques. The session is designed to build a strong foundation in Python, equipping you with essential skills for data analysis in future projects. Additionally, you will complete exercises tailored to specific engineering disciplines to apply the concepts you learn."

    "## NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy (Numerical Python) is a key library for performing numerical calculations in Python, designed to make working with large sets of numbers much easier and faster. It allows you to create and manipulate collections of numbers that are arranged in a structured format. For example, a simple list of numbers can be stored and managed more efficiently using NumPy. When these numbers are organised in rows and columns, they form what is called a matrix, which is useful for handling more complex data like images, signals, or large datasets. NumPy also includes a wide range of mathematical functions that allow for quick and efficient calculations on these collections of numbers, making it essential for scientific computing, data analysis, and engineering tasks. It integrates well with other Python libraries, such as **Pandas** for data handling, **SciPy** for scientific computations, and **Matplotlib** for creating graphs and visualisations."

An alias (typically shorter name) can be given using the \"as\" statement to facilitate writing code. You can only do this once in a notebook, but remember to run the cell before any other to avoid errors saying that `np` has not been defined."
